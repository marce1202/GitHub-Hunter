Reflection on In Plato’s Cave  

Photography is the opportunity to have a peak at what the others see. It is the frozen image that can be relieved, replayed and imagined in our minds every time we see it in a photo.  

The popular saying “art thrives in misery” could be a reason why many photographic pieces gain recognition during moments of crisis, like war and pain.  The image of misery, when framed through the lens, becomes something people consume aesthetically. This is one of the disturbing truths Sontag mentions, photography both informs and anesthetizes. 

One of Sontag’s most striking comparisons is between photography and orgasm; a comparison that she uses to show the intense feelings of the act of taking a picture. I admit that I found this comparison difficult since it did not seem rational. To me, it seemed exaggerated and somewhat out of place. It could be that her point was not meant to give a literal expression but more so that the act of photographing can provoke that kind of intense emotional response, feeling satisfaction every time a picture. She brings out more the emotional side of photography, an urge to capture the moment, to possess the image, and to feel satisfaction in doing so. Photography, in her opinion, seems to be not able to be separated from emotion, because one could say art itself is inseparable from feelings. 

I think it is important to also recognize the rational side of photography, which Sontag mentions briefly but does not emphasize it enough. She observes that photographers often take multiple shots until they arrive at the one that feels “perfect.” This process reveals photography as a search for truth, or at least a closer approximation to it. The satisfaction of finding the right image is not only emotional but intellectual. A desire to make sense of reality, by selecting the one that captures reality as it is perceived by the photographer or even others. I think that is the beauty of it. To be able to express and communicate a message with just an image. On the one hand, it could be addictive because it can mix all kinds of emotions, or even the desire to hold on to a memory that was lost gone. On the other hand, a rational need to document, organize, and interpret the world is also a reason. Sontag reminds us that photographs are never neutral, they are many times biased, choices framed by intention, by taste, and by ideology. Yet within those choices lies our human attempt to both experience and understand life. 

To me, this is where the power of photography lies. It is not an addiction, nor just an aestheticization of suffering. The photograph may never fully contain reality, but it can reflect our endless effort to preserve it, to relive it, and to give it meaning. It could be more than searching, selecting, or feeling, or maybe all of those, but for sure it is a search of expression and truth exposed in form of images.  	 </p>
